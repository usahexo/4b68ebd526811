#  Basic Strategy for Blackjack: How to Play and Win at the Casino

If you’re looking to enjoy a game of blackjack and come out on top, then you’ll want to follow some simple basic strategy tips. We’ve put together a guide on how to play blackjack, including information on the best ways to win, as well as strategies for when to hit and stand.

To begin with, blackjack is a game that involves playing against the dealer. You’ll be dealt two cards and the aim is to reach 21 or get as close to 21 as possible, without going bust. The Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11, while all other cards are face value. If your first two cards total more than 21, you automatically lose.

The basic strategy for blackjack is all about making the best decision based on the cards you are dealt and the dealer’s up card. You’ll want to try and avoid going bust, while also not letting the dealer take advantage of you. Here are some tips for how to play blackjack:

#1: Hit if your card total is between 12 and 16

If your first two cards sum up to between 12 and 16, then you should always hit in order to try and get closer to 21. This gives you the best chance of winning against the dealer.

#2: Stand if your card total is 17 or above

If your first two cards are a 17 or higher, then you should stand in order to prevent the dealer from getting any closer to 21 than you already are. In addition, remember that if you have an Ace as one of your first two cards, it counts as either 1 or 11 – so keep that in mind when making your decision!

#3: Double down if your card total is 10 or 11

If your first two cards add up to 10 or 11, then doubling down is usually a good idea. This will give you an extra card and increase your chances of beating the dealer. However, only do this if you’re feeling confident about your chances!
