Casino fears Dana Ingots of Cai Shen

The playing public fears that casino operators in Macau will become more reliant on high-roller business from VIPs after the opening of the new $3.4 billion Cotai Central integrated resort this week.

The new casino resort, operated by Sands China Ltd, includes a 1,500-suite hotel, a huge shopping mall and a casino with 400 gaming tables and 1,600 slot machines. It dwarf’s Macau’s original Cotai Strip resorts.

Analysts say the lavish new resort is likely to siphon off VIP business from other casinos on the Cotai Strip, especially from Galaxy Entertainment Group and Wynn Macau, which have been expanding their resorts in recent months.

“This could trigger a shift in the industry towards increased reliance on VIP business and more aggressive marketing towards high-rollers,” said analysts at Union Gaming Research in a note to clients over the weekend.

Casino revenue growth in Macau has already begun to slow this year as economic conditions in mainland China deteriorated. In August, revenue grew just 2 percent year-on-year to 20.5 billion patacas ($2.6 billion), the slowest pace since March 2011.
