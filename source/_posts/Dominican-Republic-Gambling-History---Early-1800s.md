#  Dominican Republic Gambling History - Early 1800s

The Dominican Republic has a long and rich gambling history that can be traced all the way back to the early 1800s. While there are certainly other gambling-related activities that have taken place in the country over the years, it is safe to say that casino gambling has always been one of the most popular.

One of the very first mentions of casino gambling in the Dominican Republic comes from a 1813 book entitled "Noticias Históricas De Santo Domingo" by Father José M. Vigil y Velásquez. In it, he talks about how there were two casinos in operation at the time - one in downtown Santo Domingo and another in Puerto Plata.

Fast-forward to 1844 and things are really starting to heat up. That's when casino gambling is first made legal in the Dominican Republic, opening up the market for many new entrepreneurs and investors. This move also helps to attract more tourists to the country, which continues to be a driving force behind the industry even today.

By 1848, there were already six casinos operating in Santo Domingo and more were popping up all over the place. In fact, just a few years later there were so many of them that lawmakers decided to put a halt to new casino licenses in order to give existing businesses a chance to flourish.

Clearly, this did not have a negative impact on casino gambling as a whole, as can be seen by the dramatic increase in popularity that took place throughout the latter half of the 1800s. At this point, just about every major city or town had its own casino, with games like roulette becoming increasingly popular among players.

#  Dominican Republic Takes Gambling Scene by Storm in Recent Years

The Dominican Republic has been experiencing a gambling boom in recent years, with new casinos and resorts opening up across the country. Major players in the industry, such as Hard Rock International and Trump Entertainment Resorts, have taken notice and are now looking to invest in this rapidly growing market.

Why is the Dominican Republic such a hot spot for gambling? There are a few factors that come into play. The country has a large population of over 10 million people, making it one of the most populous in the Caribbean. It also has a thriving tourism industry, with over 5 million visitors coming each year. And lastly, the Dominican Republic offers a number of advantages for foreign investors, including tax breaks and repatriation of profits.

The casino industry is still relatively young in the Dominican Republic, so there is plenty of room for growth. In fact, the market is expected to grow by an annual rate of 11% through 2020, according to analysts atTechnavio. This presents a major opportunity for casino operators and investors alike.

If you're looking to get in on the action, there are a few things you need to know. First of all, be aware that gambling is illegal for Dominicans - only foreigners are allowed to gamble in casinos. This means that casino operators must apply for special licences from the government in order to admit Dominicans as guests.

Secondly, you'll want to do your due diligence when selecting a casino operator or resort. Not all operators are created equal - some have more experience and reputable brands than others. Make sure you read reviews and do your research before signing up with any particular company.

The Dominican Republic is quickly becoming one of the most popular gambling destinations in the world. If you're looking to get in on the action, now is the time to do it!

#  How Did Gambling Morph into Such a Popular Activity in the Dominican Republic?

The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean country that is known for its pristine beaches, resorts, and golf courses. But what you may not know is that the Dominican Republic is also a haven for gambling. In fact, it is estimated that between 60% and 70% of the population engages in some form of gambling. So, how did gambling become so popular in the Dominican Republic?

The roots of gambling in the Dominican Republic can be traced back to the early 1800s when the Spanish began to establish sugar plantations in the country. At this time, gambling was typically used as a way to gamble away money that was owed to plantation owners.

Fast forward to the early 1900s and you have a country that is largely populated by sugar plantation workers. These workers would often use dice games as a way to pass the time and make a little money on the side. And as more and more people started to gamble, casinos began to spring up throughout the country.

One of the reasons why gambling has become so popular in the Dominican Republic is because it is seen as a way to make easy money. This is particularly true for those living in poverty-ridden areas where there are few opportunities for economic advancement. Gambling can provide people with an opportunity to make some quick money, which can be life-changing for those who are struggling financially.

Another reason why gambling has become so popular in the Dominican Republic is because of its social aspects. Gambling can be a fun way to spend time with friends or family members and it can also be a way to bond with others. In a country that is known for its strong social fabric, it's not surprising that gambling has become such a popular activity.

#  Gambling Booming in Dominican Republic Despite Social and Economic Consequences

Gambling is booming in the Dominican Republic – but with little oversight and regulation, it’s come at a heavy social cost.

In 2017, casinos took in more than $710 million in bets, a dramatic increase from the $240 million bet in 2012. That has led to a surge in gambling-related problems, including debt, bankruptcy and family breakdowns.

What’s more, the industry is dominated by mafia-type gangs that often use violence to protect their interests. In one recent case, a casino owner was murdered after refusing to pay extortion money to a gang.

The government has taken some steps to address the issue, such as passing a law banning people under 21 from entering casinos. But much more needs to be done.

For starters, the government should increase regulation of the industry and enforce existing laws. This would help ensure that casinos are run responsibly and that gambling is not harming people’s lives or livelihoods.

Second, the government should invest in public education campaigns about the risks of gambling. These campaigns would help people understand how easy it is to lose control over one’s gambling and the potential consequences of doing so.

Third, the government should provide support services for those who suffer from gambling addiction. This would include addiction treatment as well as financial and legal assistance for those who have gotten into debt because of gambling.

Fourth, the government should ban advertising for casinos and other forms of gambling. This would help keep people from spending money on gambling activities that can have harmful consequences for their families and communities.
