#  Wild Dolphin Game Focuses on Fun and Conservation

A new game is in the works that will allow players to help protect dolphins in their natural habitats.

Wild Dolphin Adventure is a free-to-play 3D simulation game for PC, Mac and mobile devices set for release in early 2018. The game will let players swim and play with dolphins in the open ocean, working together to keep the pod healthy and vibrant.

Players collect food to keep the dolphins fed, and must also watch out for factors that could harm them, like pollution and boat traffic. In addition to promoting conservation through gameplay, 20% of all profits from the game will be donated to charities that work to protect dolphins in the wild.

“The team at Deep Silver Dambuster is incredibly excited to be developing Wild Dolphin Adventure; we wanted to make a game that would both entertain and educate players about the importance of preserving these beautiful creatures,” said Huw Beynon, Head of Studio at Deep Silver Dambuster.

Originating from an idea by Koch Media Managing Director Klemens Kundratitz, Wild Dolphin Adventure is being developed by UK-based Deep Silver Dambuster – previously known as Crytek UK.

#  Get Up Close and Personal with Dolphins in the Wild Dolphin Game 
The waters of the planet Earth are home to one of the most intelligent creatures on land or sea - the dolphin. While they have been kept in captivity and trained by humans for centuries, there is nothing quite like watching them frolic and play in their natural environment. Dolphin encounters are an amazing opportunity to get up close and personal with these friendly and curious marine mammals. 

There are many tour operators that offer dolphin-watching expeditions, but if you want to see dolphins in their natural habitat, there's no better place than The Dominican Republic. Here you can swim and snorkel with dolphins in their own world - a breathtaking experience you will never forget. 

To experience dolphins in their native environment, head to Samana Province on the northeast coast of the island. In this area, the warm Caribbean waters are teaming with dolphins, humpback whales and other marine life. The best time to go is during January through March when the humpback whales migrate north to give birth. 

The tours usually start out with a short briefing on how to behave around wild dolphins - basically just be respectful and keep your distance. Then it's into the water you go! Most operators use small Zodiac boats which allow you close access to the action (and also keeps you safe from any dorsal fins). 

The dolphins here are very curious and playful so it's not uncommon for them to come right up to you. They often ride the bow wave of the boat or hang out near the engine for a little warmth. If you're lucky, you may even get a chance to touch one! Just remember that these animals are still wild and should be treated as such. 

A trip to swim with dolphins is a unique experience that will leave you feeling exhilarated and connected to nature. So why not add it to your bucket list?
