#  So, who IS the girl on the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial?

The girl on the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial is Lyndsey Fonseca. She is a 16-year-old high school student from Iowa who was chosen to be in the ad.

Fonseca was one of 40 girls who auditioned for the part, and she ended up being the winner. She says that she is excited to represent her home state in the ad.

Bingo Blitz is a popular online bingo game, and the company decided to launch a new advertising campaign featuring people from all 50 states. The goal of the campaign is to show that Bingo Blitz is a game that anyone can play, no matter where they are from.

The commercial featuring Fonseca will air during the Super Bowl on February 5th. In it, she can be seen playing bingo alongside other Iowans and talking about how much she loves the game.

#  Could THIS be the girl from the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial?

The Internet is buzzing with speculation that a girl in a recent Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial is the same girl in a 2010 Geico commercial. In the Geico commercial, the girl (who is about 4 years old at the time) confidently exclaims that she’s going to be a “supermodel.” Now, some people are convinced that the little girl in the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial is the same one from the Geico commercial – and they’ve even come up with evidence to support their claim.

For starters, both girls have brown hair and blue eyes. They’re also similar in height and build. But perhaps the most convincing evidence is that both girls were born in Des Moines, Iowa.

So, is this really the little girl from the 2010 Geico commercial? We may never know for sure, but it’s certainly an interesting possibility!

#   Mystery solved! Here's who the girl on the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial is.4. Who is the surprised lady in the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial?

The commercial, which can be viewed on YouTube, starts with a girl in a pink shirt and blue jeans looking at a computer screen. She is surprised when she sees an image of herself on the screen. The commercial then cuts to a woman who is presumably the girl's mother. The woman looks surprised and happy when she sees her daughter on the computer screen.

The identity of the girl in the commercial has been a mystery for some time. However, we can now confirm that the girl is Lizzy Duty, an actress from Cedar Rapids, IA. Duty has appeared in several commercials and TV shows, including Cedar Rapids, Hallmark's Good Witch, and most recently as Addie on NBC's This Is Us.

When contacted by KCRG-TV9, Lizzy Duty said "I was just as surprised as anyone when I saw myself on the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial! It was so much fun to shoot and I'm excited to see how it turns out."

So there you have it - the girl in the Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial is Lizzy Duty!

# 5. Bingo Blitz Iowa commercial: Who is that mystery girl?

On Feb. 12, 2019, Bingo Blitz released a new commercial entitled “Iowa.” The commercial is set in the small town of Iowa and features a number of local residents, including a mystery girl who has caught the attention of many viewers.

In the commercial, the mystery girl is shown walking down a street in Iowa and then stopping to look at some pigs in a pen. She then turns to the camera with a puzzled expression on her face and says, “I don’t know what bingo is, but I want in.”

Since the release of the commercial, there has been much speculation about who the mystery girl is. Some people have guessed that she is an actress or model who was hired to promote Bingo Blitz, while others believe that she is an actual resident of Iowa.

So far, neither Bingo Blitz nor the mystery girl has revealed anything about her identity. However, it is likely that we will find out more about her in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we can only speculate about who she is and what she’s doing in Iowa.
