#  Who Makes More Money: An Online Casino or a Slot Machine Company Named After Francis Ford Coppola?

In the movie "The Godfather," Don Vito Corleone famously states, "It's not personal, it's business." In the corporate world, this is often the guiding principle behind making tough decisions. And when it comes to money, nothing is more personal than how much one earns.

So, who makes more money: an online casino or a slot machine company named after Francis Ford Coppola? The answer may surprise you.

Let's take a look at some of the numbers. Forbes reported that in 2016, the gaming industry as a whole earned over $117 billion in revenue. Of that total, casinos accounted for $41.7 billion while manufacturers of gaming machines brought in $75.9 billion.

What this tells us is that slot machine companies make more money than casinos do. But does this mean that they are more profitable? Not necessarily. Casino operators have higher costs associated with running their businesses (e.g., rent, salaries, marketing) than slot machine companies do. So while the former may earn less per dollar gambled, they nonetheless generate more overall revenue.

This isn't to say that slot machine companies don't have any expenses; they do. But their costs are generally lower than those of casinos, which means they can be more profitable on a percentage basis. In fact, according to Forbes' list of the world's most profitable companies, four of the top 10 are slot machine manufacturers (including #1 Gtech and #2 International Game Technology).

So who makes more money: an online casino or a slot machine company named after Francis Ford Coppola? The answer is slot machine manufacturers. They make more money and are more profitable than casinos.

The downside of downtown Las Vegas is that it's not as easy to get around as the Strip. The streets are narrower and there is less parking available. But it's worth making the effort to visit downtown Las Vegas, especially if you're looking for a good bargain.

Downtown Las Vegas is home to some great restaurants, including Carson Kitchen, Glutton, Oscar’s Steakhouse and Public House 711.
