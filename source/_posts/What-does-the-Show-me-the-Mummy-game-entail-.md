# Where can I find Show me the Mummy? 

This is an age-old question that has yet to be fully answered. While there are a few locations where it is rumored to be hidden, none have been confirmed.

The first known mention of the mummy was in the diary of Dr. Henry Jekyll. In it, he claims to have seen the cursed artifact in the possession of Mr. Edward Hyde. This was back in 1885, and Mr. Hyde disappeared soon afterwards, leading many to believe that he had taken the mummy with him.

A few years later, in 1892, Mark Twain reported seeing the mummy during his travels through Egypt. However, he was never able to produce any evidence of its existence and his report was eventually dismissed as a hoax.

Since then, there have been numerous unconfirmed sightings of the mummy, but no one has been able to provide definitive proof of its whereabouts. Some believe that it is hidden in an ancient tomb somewhere in Egypt, while others believe that Mr. Hyde may have taken it to America.

So far, the only thing that is for certain is that no one knows where Show me the Mummy is hidden.

# How do I play Show me the Mummy? 

If you want to play Show me the Mummy, you will need to know how to use a board game. The first thing you'll need to do is set up the game board. This is done by taking the lid off the game box and flipping it over so that the green side is facing up. Six mummy tokens are placed on the green spaces around the outside of the board. The three sarcophagus pieces are placed in the center of the board, with the gold one in the front and the two black ones in back.

Each player chooses a color and takes all of the pieces of that color. Place your player piece in front of you on space "1." Shuffle the cards and deal six cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face down next to the board to create a draw pile. The youngest player goes first.

On a player's turn, they draw one card from either the deck or from another player's hand (if desired). They then play one card, following these rules:
Cards of equal rank cancel each other out (e.g., two 4s cancel each other out). 
Cards of different rank but same suit are worth their face value (e.g., two clubs = 2 points). 
A King is worth 13 points. 
An Ace is worth 1 point. 
A Joker is wild and can be used as any other rank or suit (e.g., two Jokers = 26 points).

The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the game!
