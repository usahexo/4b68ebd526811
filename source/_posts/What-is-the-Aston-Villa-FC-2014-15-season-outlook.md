#  What is the Aston Villa FC 2014-15 season outlook?

With a new owner, a new manager, and plenty of offseason moves, there's plenty of excitement surrounding Aston Villa FC as they head into the 2014-15 season.

One big question mark is who will be the starting goalkeeper. Shay Given has left the club, and both Brad Guzan and Jed Steer are vying for the starting spot.

Another question mark is how the team will fare without their captain and top scorer from last season, Christian Benteke. He was sold to Liverpool for £32.5 million, leaving a big hole in the Aston Villa offense.

The good news is that there are several talented young players who are hungry to step up and fill Benteke's shoes. Gabby Agbonlahor has been with Aston Villa since he was a teenager, and he's ready to take on a bigger role this season. Other young players to watch include Jack Grealish, André Green, and Carles Gil.

Manager Paul Lambert is confident that his team can compete in the Premier League this season. "There are no guarantees in life but I certainly think we'll be okay," Lambert said in an interview with The Guardian. "I think we'll surprise a few people."

The fans of Aston Villa FC are hopeful that the team can have a successful season and return to the Premier League playoffs.

#  What is the Aston Villa FC style of play?

Aston Villa is an English football club that was founded in 1874. It competes in the Championship, England's second-highest division of professional football. The club has a long and successful history, having won seven major trophies, including the European Cup in 1982. Aston Villa is known for its attacking style of play, which focuses on passing and moving the ball quickly to create chances.

Under new manager Steve Bruce, Aston Villa has played a more defensive style of football, relying on strong defensive organisation and counter-attacks to score goals. This change in approach has resulted in mixed results, with the club currently sitting in 13th place in the Championship table. However, with a number of talented young players in the squad, Aston Villa can still play an exciting brand of football that will excite the fans and hopefully lead to success in the future.

#  What is the Aston Villa FC history?

The Aston Villa Football Club is a professional association football club based in Aston, Birmingham, that competes in the Championship, the second tier of English football. The club was founded in 1874 and played at their home ground, Villa Park, from 1897. The team won the inaugural FA Cup in 1887. They reached the final again in 1895, but lost to local rivals West Bromwich Albion.

The 1960s saw Villa win the League Cup twice and reach the FA Cup final. In 1982 they reached the European Cup final, losing to Spanish side Barcelona. The following year they won the European Super Cup after beating Bayern Munich 2–1. The team also reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1962 and 1967, but lost on both occasions.

The club have been champions of England three times (1894, 1896 and 1908), runners-up twice (1895 and 1920) and have won the FA Cup seven times (1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1897, 1900, 1957). They also reached the final of the League Cup twice (1992 and 1994) and the UEFA Cup final once (1983).

Aston Villa were relegated from the Premier League for the first time ever at the end of the 2015/16 season after finishing 17th – one place above Henley-on-Thames-based rival Queens Park Rangers – having only avoided relegation on goal difference two years earlier. Despite an increase in revenue for 2016/17 – largely due to Financial Fair Play rules coming into effect – Villa still made a loss of £81 million last season; their seventh consecutive year in deficit since Randy Lerner relinquished control of the club to Dr Tony Xia in July 2016
