#  Get Your Bet On: Fun88 Open to 18 Year Old Gamblers

It's not often that gambling sites open their doors to those who are still in high school, but Fun88 is doing just that. The site has announced that it will now be accepting bets from anyone 18 years or older. This makes Fun88 one of the few legal gambling sites for US residents.

This new policy is likely in response to the recent changes in gambling laws in the United States. A number of states have now legalized online gambling, and Fun88 wants to make sure that its players are able to take advantage of these new opportunities.

So far, the new policy seems to be working well for the site. In a statement released by Fun88, they said that their traffic levels had "increased significantly" since making the change. This is good news for players and for the site itself, as it means that there is more money being wagered on each game.

If you're looking for a place to bet on your favourite sports teams or play casino games, then Fun88 should be at the top of your list. With its expansive selection of games and generous bonus offers, there's no better place to wager your hard-earned money. So what are you waiting for? Sign up today and start winning big!
