#  How To Play Double Down Casino Like Brigitte Bardot 

In Brigitte Bardot’s day, there wasn’t the internet. If you wanted to gamble, you had to go to a casino. For Brigitte, that was no problem. She was a regular at the casino in Deauville, and not just because of her love for gambling. It was also a great place to meet people. “The casino is my living room and my theatre,” she once said.

These days, of course, we have the internet and all sorts of other ways to gamble from the comfort of our own homes. But that doesn’t mean casinos are obsolete—far from it! In fact, if you want to play Double Down Casino like Brigitte Bardot, casinos are still the place to be. Here are some tips:

Pick your casino wisely
Not all casinos are equal. Some are better than others when it comes to customer service, atmosphere, and games offered. Do some research before you choose one—or several—and make a list of criteria that’s important to you. Maybe you want one with a great spa so you can relax after a long day of gambling; or maybe you want one with lots of different types of games so you can switch it up every now and then. Whatever your priorities may be, make sure the casino(s) you choose meet them.

Dress for success
Just like in any other type of social situation, it’s important to dress appropriately when gambling in a casino. This doesn’t mean dressing up like Lady Gaga or Don Draper; just aim for smart-casual instead of slouchy-casual. You don’t want to look like you’ve just come from the gym or the beach!

Bring your A-game
When playing any type of game in a casino, it’s important to stay calm and focused. This isn’t easy when there’s money on the line (especially if you’re playing roulette or blackjack), but if you keep your head cool, you stand a better chance of winning—and walking away with more than what you came with.
