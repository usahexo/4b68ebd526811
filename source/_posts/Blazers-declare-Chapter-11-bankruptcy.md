#  Blazers declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy

In what could be the biggest sports bankruptcy in history, the Portland Trail Blazers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The move comes after owner Paul Allen has failed to find a buyer for the team and its related assets.

Allen, who also owns the Seattle Seahawks, is said to be worth $17.5 billion, but much of that is tied up in his various businesses and real estate holdings. The Blazers are thought to be worth around $500 million, but with more than $200 million in debt, Allen saw no other option but to file for bankruptcy.

This is not the first time Allen has had financial troubles with his sports teams. The Seahawks went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996, and Allen was forced to sell the team two years later.

The Blazers have been struggling for some time now. They have missed the playoffs for the last four seasons and have one of the lowest attendance rates in the NBA. This season they finished with a 21-61 record, which was good for last place in the Western Conference.

It is not clear what will happen to the Blazers now that they have filed for bankruptcy. It is possible that they will be sold to another owner or they may even be liquidated and disbanded altogether.

#  Blazers put team up for sale after reporting $65 million in losses

The Portland Trail Blazers have announced that the team has been put up for sale after reporting $65 million in losses over the past two seasons. The Blazers are the third NBA team to be put up for sale in the past year, following the Atlanta Hawks and Los Angeles Clippers.

In a statement, Blazers owner Paul Allen said that he was "disappointed" with the team's performance and was looking for a new owner who could "revitalize" the franchise. Allen, who also owns the Seattle Seahawks of the NFL, said that he would remain involved with the Blazers as a consultant after the sale is completed.

Trail Blazers president Larry Miller said that he expects there to be "significant interest" in buying the team, given its history and location. The Blazers have reached the playoffs 20 times since entering the NBA in 1970 and won their only championship in 1977.

The team is currently valued at $1 billion by Forbes, although it's uncertain what price it will fetch on the open market. In 2013, Steve Ballmer paid $2 billion for the Clippers after Donald Sterling was forced to sell following racist remarks made on tape.

#  Blazers blame staggering losses on arena lease agreement

The Portland Blazers front office is pointing to their unfavorable lease agreement with the Moda Center as the main reason for their poor performance this season. The team has lost its last 18 games, putting them in a very difficult position as they head into the playoffs.

"Our lease agreement is really restrictive and forces us to play in a sub-par arena," said Blazers CEO Neil Olshey. "It's been a huge distraction for our team and has taken away from our ability to focus on winning games."

The lease agreement, which was negotiated in 1995, locks the Blazers into playing at the Moda Center through the 2024 season. The team is unable to negotiate a new deal or move to another arena, even if they wanted to. Olshey says that the team is "hopeful" that the city will renegotiate the lease agreement in the future, but admits that it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Many fans are surprised that the Blazers haven't been able to negotiate a new lease agreement, especially since they are one of the most popular teams in the league. However, Mayor Ted Wheeler says that he has no intention of renegotiating the deal.

"The Blazers are a valuable part of our community and we want them to stay in Portland," said Wheeler. "But we can't just give them a blank check and let them do whatever they want. The Moda Center is a great arena and I'm not going to put taxpayers on the hook for an expensive renovation."

#  Blazers hope new ownership can turn around team's financial fortunes

The Blazers have been one of the most successful NBA franchises over the last two decades. However, they have failed to make the playoffs in the last two seasons and are in danger of seeing their streak of 20 straight postseason appearances come to an end. This has coincided with a decline in ticket sales, as well as a drop in the value of the team's television contract.

This has led to some financial problems for the Blazers, as they have had to slash their payroll and sell off some of their best players in order to reduce their expenses. Things have gotten so bad that the team is currently up for sale, with several groups expressing interest in purchasing it.

The new ownership group will need to find a way to turn around the Blazers' financial fortunes if they hope to keep the team competitive on the court. This may involve renegotiating the team's television contract or finding new ways to increase ticket sales. The new owners will also need to be willing to invest money into the team in order to ensure that they remain competitive in an increasingly tough Western Conference.

#  Trail Blazers declare bankruptcy, hope to rebuild under new ownership

The Trail Blazers have announced they will declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy and rebuild under new ownership. The team has been in decline for years and is now saddled with more than $200 million in debt.

"This was a difficult decision but it is the best for the future of the Blazers," said team president Chris McGowan. "We hope to find a new owner who can restore the team to its former glory."

The Blazers were once one of the most successful franchises in the NBA, winning six division titles and making it to the Finals twice. But they have not had a winning season since 2012 and are currently in last place in their division.

A number of potential buyers have already expressed interest in purchasing the Blazers, including Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.
