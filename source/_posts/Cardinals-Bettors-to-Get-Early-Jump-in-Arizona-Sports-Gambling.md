#  Cardinals Bettors to Get Early Jump in Arizona Sports Gambling

It’s already been a big year for Arizona sports gambling, with the Diamondbacks and Suns both making the playoffs. But things are just getting started, with the Cardinals set to open as the early favorites in the NFL.

On Monday, Bovada released its odds for win totals and Super Bowl odds for all 32 teams. The Cardinals are pegged as 8-1 favorites to win the Super Bowl, putting them third behind only the New England Patriots (5-1) and Philadelphia Eagles (7-2).

For win totals, Arizona is set at 9.5 wins. That’s good enough for second in the NFC West behind only Seattle (10.5).

There are plenty of other intriguing bets on the Cardinals as well. You can currently get +275 odds on them winning the NFC Championship, while their odds of winning the division are -150.

The team’s offense should be one of the best in the league once again this year, led by Carson Palmer and David Johnson. And with a defense that ranked sixth in points allowed last season, there’s a good chance they can make another deep playoff run.

If you’re looking to put some money down on Arizona, now is definitely the time to do it. The odds won’t stay this good for long.

#  Cardinals Among First in NFL to Start Sports Betting in AZ

Arizona Cardinals fans were some of the first in the NFL to be able to place a bet on their favorite team with the opening of sports betting in the state.

The Cardinals are coming off a disappointing year, finishing with an 8-8 record. However, there is optimism for the upcoming season, as new head coach Kliff Kingsbury brings his high-powered offense to the desert.

Fans can place bets on the Cardinals at any of the eight sportsbooks that have recently opened in Arizona. Sports betting is now legal in nine states, after New Jersey won its Supreme Court case to overturn a federal law banning it.

The Cardinals will open their season at home against the Detroit Lions on September 8th. The Lions are coming off a disappointing season of their own, finishing with a 6-10 record. The odds currently favor the Cardinals by 3 points.

There are many other betting options available for Cardinals fans, including over/under bets on total points scored and which player will score the first touchdown of the season. There is also futures betting available on who will win the Super Bowl this year.

The Eagles are currently favored to win it all, with odds of 6-1. The Patriots are close behind with odds of 7-1, followed by the Rams at 10-1. The Cardinals are listed at 50-1, making them longshots to win it all this year.

However, anything can happen in the NFL and anything can happen in sports betting. So make sure to do your research and put your money down on who you think will come out on top!

#  State Looks Forward to tax revenue from Arizona sports gambling

The state of Arizona is pleased to have the opportunity to collect taxes from legalized sports gambling. The move is expected to provide much-needed revenue for the state, which has been struggling in recent years.

Governor Doug Ducey applauded the vote by the state legislature to legalize sports betting, noting that it would help to bolster funding for education and other important programs. He also said that the state was well-prepared to regulate and tax the new industry.

State officials expect that sports gambling will bring in around $100 million per year in tax revenue. This money will be used to support a variety of important initiatives, including education, infrastructure improvements, and public safety.

Arizona is not alone in its enthusiasm for sports gambling; other states are also gearing up for legalization. New Jersey, for example, recently began offering sports betting at its casinos and racetracks. Delaware and West Virginia have also begun allowing sports betting in certain areas.

It is expected that more states will follow suit in the coming months and years, as lawmakers become increasingly comfortable with the idea of legalized sports gambling. This new industry is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, making it a major boon for state governments across the country.

#  Arizonans Can Place Bets on Various Sports Starting Monday

As of Monday, September 17, 2018, Arizona residents will officially be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sports through the state's newly regulated gambling industry. The Arizona Department of Gaming (ADG) has released the list of approved operators for both in-person and online sports betting.

As one of the more than 20 states to have legalized some form of sports gambling in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in May to overturn the federal ban, Arizonans now have a variety of choices when it comes to how they want to bet on games. The state has already been home to tribal gaming operations that have taken bets on horse races and other sporting events for years, but the ADG says that Monday's rollout will include both in-person and online platforms from seven different operators.

"We are excited about this new chapter in Arizona gaming," said Daniel Bergin, director of the ADG, in a press release announcing the move. "Our department is prepared to administer a safe and fair environment for all involved in sports betting."

The seven approved operators are:

· Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort (owned by Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community)
• Ainsworth Game Technology Inc.
• CG Technology LLC (formerly Cantor Gaming) 
• Frias Properties Inc. 
• IGT (International Game Technology) 
• The Meadows Racetrack and Casino (owned by FilmOn Holdings) 
• William Hill US

#  Governor Announces Date That Sports Wagering Begins in Arizona

On Wednesday, Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona announced that full-scale sports wagering will begin in the state on September 1. This follows the US Supreme Court's decision in May to legalize sports gambling nationwide.

In preparation for the launch, the governor's office has been working with the Arizona Lottery to develop a regulatory framework for sports betting. That framework is expected to be released next week.

"This is an exciting day for Arizona," said Governor Ducey. "Our state is home to some of the best sports fans in the country, and now they will be able to place their bets on their favorite teams."

Arizona is one of several states that have moved quickly to implement sports gambling since the Supreme Court ruling. New Jersey, which had spearheaded the challenge to the ban on sports betting, began taking bets within days of the ruling.

Governor Ducey said that Arizona's regulated system will protect consumers and ensure that gaming is conducted fairly and openly. He also pledged to use revenue from sports betting to support public education in the state.
