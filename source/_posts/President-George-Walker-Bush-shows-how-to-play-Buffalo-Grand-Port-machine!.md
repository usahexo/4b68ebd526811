#  President George Walker Bush: How to play Buffalo Grand Port machine

This game is one of the most popular on the casino floor and it is easy to see why. The game play is relatively simple, but there are a few things you need to know in order to make the most of your game.

The object of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. You can hit or stand according to your hand. You will also be dealt two cards face down and one face up. The face up card is used to determine the rank of your hand. In addition, there are two wild symbols that can appear on the reels – the buffalo and the Grand Port logo.

If you are dealt two cards of the same rank (e.g., two eights), you have a blackjack and will automatically win unless the dealer has blackjack too, in which case it is a tie. If your first card is an Ace, you can choose whether to take another card (hit) or keep playing with your current total (stand).

Once you have made all of your decisions for that turn, press deal again and receive new cards accordingly. If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically no matter what else happens in the game round. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.

In order to win money, you need to beat the dealer’s total without going over 21 yourself. If both you and the dealer have bust, then it is a push and no one wins or loses money on that round. Winning bets are paid at even money minus a 5% commission taken by the house; thus, a winning $10 bet would pay out $9.50 ($10 x .95 = $9.50).

One important thing to note: if you split a pair (split means doubling your bet and getting another card for each of the two original cards), then both new hands must be played out before hitting or standing again; unlike regular blackjack where you can only hit once per split hand.

 There are a few basic tips that will help increase your chances when playing Buffalo Grand Port machine: 

-Always remember that Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, depending on what will give you the best chance of winning against the dealer’s hand; 
-Be aware of when it’s worth splitting pairs (i.e., when both new hands would still give you a better chance than standing with just one card); 
-Remember that if you bust, you lose automatically, so think twice before risking everything on one turn; 
-Use your wild symbols wisely – they can help fill in gaps in your hand and improve your chances of winning!
