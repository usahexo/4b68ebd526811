        <h1 id="Which-often-Communities-Are-Opting-Out-In-Gambling-Casinos-In-Pa"><a href="#Which-often-Communities-Are-Opting-Out-In-Gambling-Casinos-In-Pa" class="headerlink" title="Which often Communities Are Opting Out In Gambling Casinos In Pa?"></a>Which often Communities Are Opting Out In Gambling Casinos In Pa?</h1><p>The gambling casinos in Pennsylvania are seeing a rise of communities that are opting out of having them in their boundaries. There are several reasons for this, but one of the main ones is the impact that the casinos have on the communities.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts that the casinos have is on crime rates. Studies have shown that when casinos are put into a community, there is a rise in crime rates. This is because people who visit the casino may be looking to make a quick profit by stealing from others or cheating.</p>
<p>Another big impact that the casinos can have on a community is through their finances. When a casino moves into a town, it can often suck money out of the town. This is because people will visit the casino and spend their money there rather than spending it at businesses in the town. This can lead to a loss of jobs and businesses in the town.</p>
<p>Finally, another big reason why communities are opting out of having gambling casinos is because of the negative effects that they can have on residents’ mental health. Gambling can often be addictive and it can lead to people becoming addicted to it. This can lead to them losing money and becoming depressed or stressed as a result.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Communities-Have-Chosen-To-Not-Have-A-Gambling-Casino"><a href="#Which-Communities-Have-Chosen-To-Not-Have-A-Gambling-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Which Communities Have Chosen To Not Have A Gambling Casino?"></a>Which Communities Have Chosen To Not Have A Gambling Casino?</h1><p>A growing number of communities throughout the United States have decided they do not want a gambling casino in their town or city. This is in spite of the potential financial benefits that these businesses can bring to a municipality.</p>
<p>One example is the town of West Brattleboro, Vermont. In a referendum held in 2016, the town’s residents voted against a proposal from Capital Gaming to build a $60 million casino in the community. </p>
<p>According to Don Campbell, chairman of the Board of Selectmen in West Brattleboro, one reason for the community’s opposition was concern about increased traffic and congestion. Campbell also noted that many residents were opposed to the idea of having a casino in their town on moral grounds. </p>
<p>Another community that has decided against a gambling casino is Clayton, New York. In December 2017, the Clayton Town Board voted unanimously to prohibit any type of casino gambling within its borders. </p>
<p>Community leaders in Clayton cited concerns about public safety, traffic congestion, and negative impacts on local businesses as reasons for their decision. They also noted that there was no guarantee that a gambling casino would bring significant financial benefits to the community. </p>
<p>There are many other examples of communities that have chosen not to have a gambling casino within their boundaries. This trend is likely to continue as more and more people become aware of the potential negative consequences associated with these businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Several-Communities-Are-Considering-Opting-Away-From-Gambling-Casinos"><a href="#Several-Communities-Are-Considering-Opting-Away-From-Gambling-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Several Communities Are Considering Opting Away From Gambling Casinos"></a>Several Communities Are Considering Opting Away From Gambling Casinos</h1><p>The Gambling Commission is urging local communities to come up with a plan for casinos before they are allowed to open. The group feels that not enough research has been done on the social and economic effects of gambling venues. </p>
<p>Some towns have already decided not to pursue casinos, while others are still on the fence. One of the main concerns is that gambling addiction could lead to an increase in crime and poverty. There is also worry about how much money will actually flow into these communities. </p>
<p>Many people are in favor of casinos because they bring in jobs and tax revenue. However, opponents believe the negatives outweigh the positives. They argue that the social cost of gambling addiction is too high and that the economic benefits are not as great as proponents claim. </p>
<p>As the debate over casinos heats up, it will be interesting to see which communities decide to opt out and why.</p>
<h1 id="Pocono-Township-Decides-Against-Opting-Away-From-Gambling-Casinos"><a href="#Pocono-Township-Decides-Against-Opting-Away-From-Gambling-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Pocono Township Decides Against Opting Away From Gambling Casinos"></a>Pocono Township Decides Against Opting Away From Gambling Casinos</h1><p>After much deliberation, the Pocono Township Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to keep legalized gambling casinos in the municipality. This decision comes despite an offer from a gaming company to buy the land where the casinos are currently located and move them elsewhere.</p>
<p>Municipal officials have been considering opting out of having casinos since January, when news broke that Pinnacle Entertainment was planning to purchase the property on which Mount Airy Casino Resort and Split Rock Resort Casino are both located. Pinnacle offered to purchase the land for $100 million and move both casinos elsewhere, but township officials were unsure if they wanted to lose the tax revenue generated by the casinos.</p>
<p>After months of considering their options, the Pocono Township Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 on Tuesday night to keep the casinos in their municipality. Supervisor Frank Kimball cast the dissenting vote, saying he thought it was important for the township to maximize its revenue potential. Supervisor Chairwoman Lisa Brown said that she believed it was more important to maintain control over development in the area.</p>
<p>The vote means that Pinnacle Entertainment’s offer is now off the table, but there is no guarantee that it will revisit its plans to purchase the property in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Barrett-Township-Considers-Opting-Out-Of-Gambling-Casinos"><a href="#Barrett-Township-Considers-Opting-Out-Of-Gambling-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Barrett Township Considers Opting Out Of Gambling Casinos"></a>Barrett Township Considers Opting Out Of Gambling Casinos</h1><p>In the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, Barrett Township is considering a measure that would allow them to opt out of any future gambling casinos in the area. The proposed bill, which was drafted by supervisor Dennis McAndrews, would give all municipalities within Monroe County the right to vote on whether or not they wanted casinos within their borders.</p>
<p>The measure comes after four communities within Monroe County expressed interest in hosting a new casino. Mount Pocono, Stroudsburg, East Stroudsburg, and Bartonsville all submitted bids to the state gaming commission in an effort to land one of the remaining two licenses that are available.</p>
<p>Barrett Township is just one of many rural communities in Pennsylvania that are worried about the impact that casinos could have on their way of life. In addition to concerns about traffic and crime, many people are worried about the possibility of lost jobs if a casino were to open up in their community.</p>
<p>“We’re a close-knit community,” said McAndrews. “We don’t want our township overrun by casinos and all of the negative consequences that come with them.”</p>
<p>The proposed bill will be discussed at a public meeting on September 12th. If it is approved, it will be put to a vote at the November election.</p>
