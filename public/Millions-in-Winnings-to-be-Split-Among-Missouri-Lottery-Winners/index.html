        <h1 id="Millions-in-Winnings-to-be-Split-Among-Missouri-Lottery-Winners"><a href="#Millions-in-Winnings-to-be-Split-Among-Missouri-Lottery-Winners" class="headerlink" title="Millions in Winnings to be Split Among Missouri Lottery Winners"></a>Millions in Winnings to be Split Among Missouri Lottery Winners</h1><p>The Missouri Lottery has announced that three players have won a share of the $22 million jackpot from the March 14th drawing. Each of the winners will receive just over $7.3 million.</p>
<p>The winning tickets were sold in Columbia, Higginsville, and Monett. The Higginsville ticket was a Powerball ticket, while the other two were Show Me Cash tickets.</p>
<p>All three winners have already come forward to claim their prizes. They have elected to receive their winnings in cash, which means they will all be taking home more than $2 million after taxes are withheld.</p>
<p>This is the second big lottery win in Missouri in recent weeks. A player in St. Louis won a $250,000 prize from the Lucky for Life game on March 3rd.</p>
<h1 id="Feds-to-Modify-Rules-Regarding-Split-of-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Feds-to-Modify-Rules-Regarding-Split-of-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Feds to Modify Rules Regarding Split of Gambling Winnings"></a>Feds to Modify Rules Regarding Split of Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Department of Justice will be making some changes to the rules affecting how gambling winnings are handled. The new rules, which will be announced later this week, will allow for a person to keep more of their winnings if they choose to split them with someone else.</p>
<p>Under the current rules, if someone splits their gambling winnings with someone else, the government considers it to be a gift and taxes both parties accordingly. The new rules, which are expected to take effect by the end of the year, will allow the person who originally won the money to keep more of it.</p>
<p>Gambling industry experts say that the change is likely to result in more people splitting their winnings with others. This could have a significant impact on casino profits, as players would be less likely to give away a portion of their winnings if they could keep it all themselves.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has not yet released specific details about the new rules, but they are expected to be similar to those that are currently in place for distributions from a trust. Under those rules, the person who receives the money is considered to have received a taxable distribution, regardless of whether they actually paid any taxes on it.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-Expect-from-Changes-Regarding-Split-of-Gambling-Winnings-in-Missouri"><a href="#What-to-Expect-from-Changes-Regarding-Split-of-Gambling-Winnings-in-Missouri" class="headerlink" title="What to Expect from Changes Regarding Split of Gambling Winnings in Missouri"></a>What to Expect from Changes Regarding Split of Gambling Winnings in Missouri</h1><p>In the state of Missouri, gambling winnings are considered taxable income by the government. This means that any individual who wins money from gambling activities is subject to pay taxes on those winnings. However, recent changes in the tax code may lead to a different story for Missouri taxpayers come 2019.</p>
<p>The new tax code, which was passed in December 2017 and went into effect as of January 2018, allows taxpayers to exclude up to $10,000 in gambling income from their taxable income. This change is a result of the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was designed to provide tax relief for American taxpayers.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Missouri taxpayers? Well, if you are a gambler and you win more than $10,000 in a given year, you will still have to pay taxes on that amount. However, if you win less than $10,000, you will not have to report those winnings as taxable income. This change provides much needed relief for gamblers in Missouri and should make filing taxes a bit easier overall.</p>
<p>While it is still unclear how this change will play out in practice, it is likely that many Missouri taxpayers will benefit from it. If you have questions about how these changes might affect you, be sure to speak with an accountant or tax specialist in your area.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-Set-Forth-New-Guidelines-for-Federal-Splitting-of-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Officials-Set-Forth-New-Guidelines-for-Federal-Splitting-of-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Officials Set Forth New Guidelines for Federal Splitting of Gambling Winnings"></a>Officials Set Forth New Guidelines for Federal Splitting of Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The United States Treasury Department has announced a new policy for how the federal government will handle gambling winnings. The new guidelines, which went into effect on January 1st, 2019, state that any gambling winnings over $5,000 will be subject to a withholding tax of 25%.</p>
<p>This change is intended to simplify the process of splitting gambling winnings among multiple winners. Under the previous policy, each winner was responsible for filing their own tax return and calculating their share of the taxable income. This often resulted in disputes among winners about who should get what portion of the winnings.</p>
<p>The new guidelines will make things simpler by requiring the gambling establishment to withhold 25% of the total winnings and then distribute that money to the IRS. This will ensure that all winners are treated equally and that everyone pays their fair share of taxes.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this withholding tax only applies to taxable gambling winnings. Gambling losses can still be deducted from your total income, just as they were under the old policy.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Lottery-Winners-rejoice-as-Federal-Splitting-Guidelines-are-announced"><a href="#Missouri-Lottery-Winners-rejoice-as-Federal-Splitting-Guidelines-are-announced" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Lottery Winners rejoice as Federal Splitting Guidelines are announced"></a>Missouri Lottery Winners rejoice as Federal Splitting Guidelines are announced</h1><p>The Missouri Lottery has some very happy winners today as the new Federal Splitting Guidelines have been released. These guidelines, which are now available to all lotto players in the United States, state that when a lottery ticket is purchased, the winnings can be split evenly between all players on the ticket.</p>
<p>“This is great news for our Missouri Lottery winners,” said Lottery Spokesman Rick Johnson. “Now they can share their winnings with their friends and family members in a fair and equitable way.”</p>
<p>Previously, lottery winnings were only able to be split among the ticket holders in certain states. But with the new Federal Splitting Guidelines, any player in any state can take advantage of this system.</p>
<p>“This will definitely make playing the lottery a more fun experience for everyone involved,” said Johnson.</p>
<p>According to the new guidelines, when a ticket is purchased, each player’s name must be listed on the ticket in order for them to be eligible for splitting the winnings. In addition, each player must provide their Social Security number or Taxpayer Identification number so that their portion of the winnings can be tracked and reported correctly.</p>
<p>Lottery officials are urging all players to review the new guidelines carefully before playing any future lotteries.</p>
