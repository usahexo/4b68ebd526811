        <h1 id="Celtics-Odds-to-Win-the-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Celtics-Odds-to-Win-the-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Odds to Win the NBA Championship"></a>Celtics Odds to Win the NBA Championship</h1><p>The Boston Celtics are coming off a successful season in which they finished with the second- best record in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics have made some big moves during the offseason, most notably signing Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are now one of the favorites to win the NBA championship.</p>
<p>The Celtics will open their season on October 17 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavs are still the favorites to win the Eastern Conference, but the Celtics have a real chance to overtake them. Irving will be looking to show Cleveland that they made a mistake in trading him and he can lead his new team to a championship.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors are still the favorites to win the NBA championship, but the Celtics have a good chance of beating them. They have a lot of depth and talent on their roster, and they will be one of the teams to watch this season.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Probability-of-Winning-the-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Celtics-Probability-of-Winning-the-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Probability of Winning the NBA Championship"></a>Celtics Probability of Winning the NBA Championship</h1><p>The Celtics had a great season, but their odds of winning the NBA championship are still just 8.5 percent, according to The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.</p>
<p>Boston is facing a tough road to the Finals, with either the Philadelphia 76ers or Milwaukee Bucks awaiting in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics would then have to beat either the Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets in the Finals.</p>
<p>But Boston is still one of the top teams in the NBA, and they have a real chance at winning it all. Let’s take a closer look at their chances of pulling off an upset and becoming NBA champions.</p>
<h1 id="The-Celtics’-odds-of-upsetting-the-76ers"><a href="#The-Celtics’-odds-of-upsetting-the-76ers" class="headerlink" title="The Celtics’ odds of upsetting the 76ers"></a>The Celtics’ odds of upsetting the 76ers</h1><p>The odds of Philadelphia beating Boston are just 1.5-to-1, which means that the 76ers are expected to win approximately two-thirds of the time. But these odds may be slightly inflated, as Boston has been playing better as of late.</p>
<p>The Celtics should be able to take down Philadelphia if they continue to play well. They have more talent than the 76ers and should be able to win most matchups between the two teams.</p>
<h1 id="The-Celtics’-odds-of-upsetting-the-Bucks"><a href="#The-Celtics’-odds-of-upsetting-the-Bucks" class="headerlink" title="The Celtics’ odds of upsetting the Bucks"></a>The Celtics’ odds of upsetting the Bucks</h1><p>The odds of Milwaukee beating Boston are only slightly better, at 2-to-1. But again, these odds may be inflated, as Milwaukee has been struggling lately.</p>
<p>Boston should be able to beat Milwaukee if they play their best basketball. The Celtics have more talent and matchup well against the Bucks. They also have homecourt advantage in this series.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Championship-Odds"><a href="#Celtics-Championship-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Championship Odds"></a>Celtics Championship Odds</h1><p>The Celtics have had an interesting offseason. The Kyrie Irving trade caught a lot of people by surprise, including me. A lot of people think that the Celtics are now the favorites to win the championship. I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>The Celtics lost one of their best players in Gordon Hayward. He was a key player for them last year and they will definitely miss him this year. Kyrie Irving is a very good player, but he is also young and inexperienced when it comes to playoff basketball. He has never been on a team that has made it past the second round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Celtics also added some other players in the offseason. They signed Gordon Hayward’s replacement, Jayson Tatum, and they signed veteran big man Greg Monroe. Both of those players are very good signings, but I don’t think they are enough to help the Celtics win the championship this year.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors are still the favorites to win the championship this year. They have won two of the last three championships and they show no signs of slowing down. The Houston Rockets are also a very strong team and I think they will be major contenders this year.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Vegas-Odds"><a href="#Celtics-Vegas-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Vegas Odds"></a>Celtics Vegas Odds</h1><p>The Celtics are coming off a successful season in which they made it to the Eastern Conference Finals. This offseason, they lost Kyrie Irving to the Brooklyn Nets, but they managed to re-sign Marcus Smart and Al Horford. Boston is now listed as the +425 second favorite behind the Golden State Warriors to win the 2019 NBA Championship.</p>
<p>The Celtics will be led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who are both entering their third year in the league. Tatum was a Rookie of the Year finalist last season and averaged 18.5 points per game in the playoffs. Brown averaged 14.5 points per game last season and impressed in the postseason with his defense.</p>
<p>In addition to Tatum and Brown, the Celtics have a number of other talented players including Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier, and Horford. Hayward is coming back from an ankle injury that caused him to miss most of last season. He is expected to be back at full strength this year and should provide a boost to Boston’s offense.</p>
<p>The Celtics may not have Kyrie Irving anymore, but they still have a very talented team that is capable of winning the championship. bet365 currently has them listed as the +425 second favorite behind the Golden State Warriors to win the 2019 NBA Championship.</p>
<h1 id="Celtics-Betting-Odds"><a href="#Celtics-Betting-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Celtics Betting Odds"></a>Celtics Betting Odds</h1><p>The Boston Celtics have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in the NBA this season, and they are currently among the favorites to win the championship. Bettors are starting to take notice of the Celtics, and the betting lines are beginning to reflect their growing popularity.</p>
<p>The Celtics opened the season with odds of 20-1 to win the championship, but those odds have shrunk to 10-1 in recent weeks. They are still behind the Golden State Warriors (5-4), Cleveland Cavaliers (7-2), and Houston Rockets (9-2), but they are ahead of teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder (12-1) and Philadelphia 76ers (20-1).</p>
<p>Boston has been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, thanks largely to their impressive young talent. Kyrie Irving is having an MVP-caliber season, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have both emerged as stars. The Celtics are also getting solid contributions from veterans like Al Horford and Gordon Hayward.</p>
<p>Boston has a lot of depth, which makes them a difficult team to beat. They can beat you in a variety of ways, with Irving leading the charge or by getting strong performances from their role players. No one knows who is going to step up on any given night, which makes them a dangerous opponent for anyone in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Celtics will face some tough challenges in the playoffs, but they appear to be up for the task. With Irving playing at an MVP level and a deep roster, they have a chance to beat anyone in the league. If you’re looking for a team that can bring you some serious profits down the stretch, look no further than Boston Celtics betting odds.</p>
